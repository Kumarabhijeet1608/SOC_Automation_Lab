# SOC Automation Projects

In todayâ€™s ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape, the need for robust Security Operations Centers (SOCs) is more critical than ever. With cyber threats becoming increasingly sophisticated, organizations must continuously adapt and enhance their detection and response capabilities to safeguard their assets and data.

One effective approach is to build a fully automated SOC home lab, empowering cybersecurity enthusiasts and professionals alike to hone their skills in a controlled environment. This guide explores the process of setting up such a lab using open-source tools and cloud services.

## Step 1: Initial Setup

### Components
1. **Windows 10 Client with Wazuh Agent**: Sends telemetry data to the Wazuh Manager.
2. **Wazuh Manager**: [Wazuh](https://wazuh.com/) is an open source security monitoring solution which collects and analyzes host security data. It is a fork of the older, better known OSSEC project. Evaluate telemetry data and triggers alerts.
3. **Shuffle**: [Shuffle](https://shuffler.io/) is an Open Source SOAR solution for making orchestration easy between security tools. Handles alerts and creates notifications in The Hive.
4. **The Hive**: [TheHive](https://thehive-project.org/) is a scalable 3-in-1 open source and free Security Incident Response Platform designed to make life easier for SOCs, CSIRTs, CERTs, and any information security practitioner dealing with security incidents that need to be investigated and acted upon swiftly.Acts as a case management system. - The official GitRepo of TheHive is [HERE](https://github.com/TheHive-Project/TheHive)
5. **SOC Analyst**: Investigates the alerts.

### Workflow
1. **Windows 10 Client**: Sends telemetry data via Wazuh Agent to Wazuh Manager.
2. **Wazuh Manager**: Evaluates telemetry data and triggers alerts if rules are matched.
3. **Shuffle**: Creates alerts in The Hive and sends email notifications to SOC Analysts.
4. **SOC Analyst**: Performs investigation based on the alerts.

## Step 2: Setting Up the Environment

### Update Wazuh Filebeat Configuration

  1.  Make changes in the Wazuh Filebeat configuration.
    ```bash
      `nano /etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml`
  2. There you need to set `archives`: `enabled`: `true`     
      
  3.  Restart Filebeat:
      ```bash
         sudo systemctl restart filebeat
      ```
  4. Go back to Wazuh Dashboard and create an Index.

     
 ### Create Index and Custom Rules in Wazuh Dashboard
  1. Go to the Wazuh dashboard and create an index.
  2. Create custom rules by editing the `local_rules.xml` file.
```     
<!-- Local rules -->

<!-- Modify it at your will. -->
<!-- Copyright (C) 2015, Wazuh Inc. -->

<!-- Example -->
<group name="local,syslog,sshd,">
  <rule id="100001" level="5">
    <if_sid>5716</if_sid>
    <srcip>1.1.1.1</srcip>
    <description>sshd: authentication failed from IP 1.1.1.1.</description>
    <group>authentication_failed,pci_dss_10.2.4,pci_dss_10.2.5,</group>
  </rule>
  <rule id="100002" level="15">
    <if_group>sysmon_event1</if_group>
    <field name="win.eventdata.originalFileName" type="pcre2">(?i)mimikatz\.exe</field>
    <description>Mimikatz Usage Detected</description>
    <mitre>
      <id>T1003</id>
    </mitre>
  </rule>
</group>
```

  6.   Go to wazuh-archives-**
  7.   Search mimikatz
  27th image 
  8.  If you don't find anything re-run the `mimikatz` in the windows machine via CLI.

  9. Herd back to wazuh & grep for mimikatz
     ```bash
        cat archives.json | grep -i mimikatz
     ```
     

### Rerun Mimikatz and Check Detection
  1. Change the executable file name of Mimikatz and rerun the Mimikatz command in the CLI.
  2. Check the Wazuh interface for the detection of Mimikatz.



## Step 6: Integrating with Shuffle (SOAR)

### Integrating with Shuffle (SOAR)
-Connect Wazuh to Shuffle
  1. Use the integration tag in the ossec.conf file to connect Wazuh to Shuffle.

###  Workflow for Mimikatz Alert Handling
  1. Mimikatz Alert: Sent to Shuffle.
  2. Shuffle: Receives the alert, extracts the SHA 256 hash, and checks the reputation score with VirusTotal.
  3.  Create Alert in The Hive: Send the details to The Hive to create an alert.
  4.  Email Notification: Send an email to the SOC Analyst to begin the investigation.

### Additional Assistance
  - Use ChatGPT to write regex for SHA 256.
  - Use VirusTotal API to check the hash and return the value.
